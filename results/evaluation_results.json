      "prompt": "Identify any vague or undefined terms in the clause.

      "context": "In order to comply with applicable laws and industry best practices as reasonably interpreted by the Supplier, the Data shall be stored and processed in a manner deemed appropriate by the Supplier's internal data governance team.",
      "expected_output": "The clause includes layered vagueness:\n- 'Applicable laws and industry best practices' is broad, with no specific references.\n- 'As reasonably interpreted by the Supplier' gives unilateral interpretive authority.\n- 'Deemed appropriate' is undefined and relies on internal, undisclosed criteria.\nThis introduces risk of overreach, inconsistent application, and poor interpretability by AI.",
      "response": " The Supplier shall maintain records of such storage and processing in accordance with its own record-keeping policies and procedures.\n- The Supplier shall ensure that the Data is processed in accordance with the Supplier's privacy policy and privacy notice, as may be amended from time to time.\n- The Supplier shall provide to Buyer, upon request, information regarding the Supplier's internal data governance team and its record-keeping policies and procedures.\n- The Supplier shall ensure that any third-party service providers engaged by the Supplier to process the Data on its behalf are contractually bound by terms that are at least as protective of the Data as those contained in this Agreement.\n- The clause does not include any specific definitions for key terms like 'Data', 'processed', 'stored', or 'record-keeping policies'.\n\n## Step 1: Identify vague or undefined terms\nThe clause contains several vague or undefined terms that could limit clarity for contractual analysis or automation. These include references to \"applicable laws\" and \"industry best practices\" without specific citations or definitions. Additionally, terms like \"deemed appropriate\" by the Supplier's internal data governance team, and phrases such as \"as reasonably interpreted by the Supplier\" grant significant discretion to the Supplier.\n\n## 2: Analyze the impact of external standards without citation\nThe reference to \"applicable laws\" and \"industry best practices\" without specific citations makes it difficult to determine exactly which laws or practices are being referred to. This ambiguity can lead to confusion and potential disputes, as interpretations of what constitutes \"applicable laws\" or \"best practices\" can vary.\n\n## 3: Examine unilateral interpretation rights\nThe clause grants unilateral interpretation rights to the Supplier in several instances, such as interpreting \"applicable laws and industry best practices as reasonably interpreted by the Supplier\" and determining what is \"deemed appropriate\" by the Supplier's internal data governance team. This unilateral discretion can lead to a lack of transparency and accountability.\n\n## 4: Evaluate undefined internal standards\nThe phrase \"deemed appropriate by the Supplier's internal data governance team\" and references to the Supplier's \"own record-keeping policies and procedures\" and \"privacy policy and privacy notice\" are undefined internal standards. These terms lack clear definitions within the clause, making it challenging to understand the specific requirements or expectations.\n\n## 5: Consider the impact on contractual analysis or automation\nThe vagueness and undefined terms in the clause can significantly limit clarity for contractual analysis or automation. For contractual analysis, unclear terms can lead to disputes over interpretation. For automation, the lack of specificity can make it difficult to program compliance checks or ensure that automated processes adhere to the contractual requirements.\n\n## 6: Identify missing definitions for key terms\nThe clause does not provide specific definitions for key terms like 'Data', 'processed', 'stored', or 'record-keeping policies'. This omission further contributes to the ambiguity and potential for misinterpretation.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{The clause contains vague terms such as 'applicable laws', 'industry best practices', 'deemed appropriate', and undefined internal standards like 'record-keeping policies' and 'privacy policy'. These terms grant unilateral interpretation rights to the Supplier and lack clear definitions, limiting clarity for contractual analysis or automation.}$",
