Focus on phrases that:\n- grant broad discretion without defined criteria\n- use open-ended business judgments like 'appropriate' or 'commercially viable'\n- rely on vague conditions like 'prevailing circumstances'\nExplain how these impact clarity or consistency of interpretation.",
      "context": "The Company may, at its sole discretion and without prior notice, terminate this Agreement at any time if it deems that continued engagement is no longer commercially viable or appropriate in light of prevailing circumstances.",
      "expected_output": "Vagueness arises from:\n- 'At its sole discretion' gives the Company unchecked control with no criteria.\n- 'Commercially viable or appropriate' are subjective terms with no measurable standard.\n- 'Prevailing circumstances' is broad and undefined, allowing arbitrary interpretation.\nThese elements introduce risk and lack predictability, particularly for machine interpretation.",
